# Design

- Functions will be implemented in Javascript. Later, we can build a UI on top of it easily.
- The functions will be implemented in a way that they can be used in a browser.

## Implementation

- The functions will be implemented in `calculator.js`.
- Pricing are stored in `constants.js`. This is to make it easier to change the pricing later.

## Unit tests

- The unit tests will be implemented in `calculator.test.js` using Mocha.
- Run the tests with `npm test`.
